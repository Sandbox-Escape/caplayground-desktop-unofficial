## üì¶ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher) - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** (for cloning) - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

Verify your installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sandbox-Escape/caplayground-desktop-unofficial.git
cd caplayground-desktop-unofficial
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs:
- Electron for the desktop application
- Express for the local server
- All other required dependencies

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

This will:
1. Start a local Express server on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Launch the Electron desktop application
3. Display the fully local CAPlayground interface

**Note**: The application creates its own local server and does not connect to any external services.

## üèóÔ∏è Building Distributable Packages

To create installers for distribution:

### Build for Current Platform
```bash
npm run build
```

### Build for Specific Platforms
```bash
# Windows
npx electron-builder --win

# macOS
npx electron-builder --mac

# Linux
npx electron-builder --linux

# All platforms
npx electron-builder --mwl
```

Built packages will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## üîß Architecture

- **Electron Main Process**: Manages the desktop application window
- **Local Express Server**: Serves the CAPlayground interface on localhost:3000
- **Built-in Editor**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based code editor
- **Local Execution**: Safe evaluation of code within the Electron context
- **No Network Dependencies**: Everything runs locally

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

This application prioritizes security and privacy:
- **No Remote Connections**: Never connects to external servers
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Code execution is contained within the application
- **No Data Collection**: No telemetry, analytics, or user tracking
- **Local Storage Only**: All data stays on your device

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration from Remote Version

If you previously used a version that connected to caplayground.pages.dev:
- **Your local code is safe**: This version doesn't access remote data
- **No cloud sync**: You'll need to manually save/backup your code
- **Fully independent**: This version works completely offline

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Port 3000 already in use"**
- Close any other applications using port 3000
- Or modify `LOCAL_PORT` in `main.js`

**Application won't start**
- Ensure Node.js and npm are properly installed
- Run `npm install` again to verify dependencies
- Check that no antivirus is blocking the application

**Code execution errors**
- Remember this is a basic execution environment
- Complex operations may need additional setup
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Getting Help
